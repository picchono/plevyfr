Intelligent products and systems are omnipresent, weave into our everyday life, and consequently have the power to transform our society.

Intelligent products and systems are omnipresent, weave into our everyday life, and consequently have the power to transform our society. Adoption of these systems in our environments invites for exploring further how we interact with our environment.<br>This research is grounded on the phenomenology of perception and ecological psychology, considering perception to be active. Perception is result of the dynamic coupling between a person’s action in relation to her or his environment and the sensory input this environment provides. In other words, we have to act to perceive and we concentrate our senses in the direction of the stimuli: e.g., turn our body around to see what is behind us, in order to perceive.<br>The research focuses on how interaction with interactive artefacts can add intrinsic value on space being experienced as a transitory space. Four topics are introduced to investigate our experience of space as transitory space: ritual, space, light and craft. They serve as the backbone of the project and we could say that the ritual is the means for the technology (light) to enable the value (sense of place) to emerge in interaction with (hand) crafted artefacts. In this project I investigate if an interactive lighting installation can trigger our sense of place and belonging in spaces.<br>Throughout this project I follow a ‘research-through-design’ approach. This is an approach where products are designed to explore implications of theory in context. The idea of perceptive qualities in interactive lighting installations is explored, and I question if an interactive artefact contributes to the experience of transition and allows for a greater feeling of involvement in the space. The project is divided into three cases:</p><ul><li>In the first case (Homelab), different light behaviours and interaction in a home situation are explored.</li><li>Simultaniously, we investigate the relationship with an interactive artefact in context. In the second design case (Videolab), the influence of an additional object on the space being experienced as transitory space is explored. In the third design case (Mirror), the gained relevant designknowledge is united and expressed in a concluding interactive light object.</li><li>With this project I aim to get a grip on how interaction with interactive artefacts can add intrinsic value on space being experienced as transitory space.<br><em>- Nadine Amersvoort -</em></li></ul></div><div class="w-2/6 pl-20 pr-5">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="w-full overflow-hidden flex flex-col md:flex-row mb-20"><div class="w-1/6 pl-5 pr-20 self-end">&nbsp;</div><div class="max-w-3xl w-full px-5"></div><div class="w-2/6 pl-20 pr-5">&nbsp;</div></div></main></body></html>
