For this aim, three frameworks are introduced and discussed (examples): complex thinking, learning, lenses &amp; perspectives, embodied theories, post-phenomenology, transition theories. Throughout the elective, students analyse the implication of these frameworks on the designs they create (as aesthetics propositions), and of designs on these frameworks.</description></item><item><title>Designing for Systemic Change</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/designing-for-systemic-change/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/designing-for-systemic-change/</guid><description>For example, should we focus on local challenges starting from an individual perspective, e.g. your grandmother with dementia that can’t live independently anymore, or should we focus on global challenges starting from the bigger perspective, e.g. how can society maintain a healthy lifestyle? Should we invest more in artificial intelligence and new technological possibilities to tackle our challenges, or should we invest more in the socio-cultural values needed to tackle our challenges?</description></item><item><title>Design 3.0 Forum</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/design-30-forum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/design-30-forum/</guid><description>DESIGN 3.0 FORUM New design paradigms for the next generation of design research

In this Design Fiction project, several potential healthcare futures are explored.</description></item><item><title>Stewart</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/stewart/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/stewart/</guid><description>Stewart has received:
the Core77 award for best interaction design student work the Golden A’ design award in engineering and technical design Stewart is a tactile interface designed for a fully autonomous car. Self-driving cars offer obvious benefits such as faster travel and enhanced safety. However, they also eliminate a sense of freedom, expression, and control while driving.
Stewart’s objective is to accommodate a healthy relation between man and machine, to be achieved by an intuitive and expressive form of interaction.</description></item><item><title>Kees Overbeeke symposium</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/kees-overbeeke-symposium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/kees-overbeeke-symposium/</guid><description>Stephan was appointed full professor of ‘Constructive Design Research in Smart Products, Services and Systems’ in the Department of Industrial Design on May 1, 2017.

It is about going to sleep, waking up, cleaning, eating, dressing and undressing, reading, drinking tea or coffee… It is therefore in the flow of the infraordinary (Perec, 1989) and the banal, away of the extraordinary and of the memorable. What the everyday is actually less a matter of activity value than a matter of ‘specific mode of manifestation’ (Dewolf, 2008).</description></item><item><title>A peine hors du lit</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/haiku-cocoa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2018 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/haiku-cocoa/</guid><description> 布団抜け匙にて点てるココアの茶

Design thinking requires practitioners to become reflective professionals. This piece of research provides a protocol and tools to guide their journey of self-reflection:
A new action research protocol (derived from Pedagogical Action Research) for design thinking practitioners, A conceptual framework (People Place Process) to guide design thinking development, in both academic and business environments, A scale-up model to develop design thinking pedagogy at the scale of an individual educator, a university and a government, An activity framework for both academic and business users to identify competences developed with (and required for) design thinking projects Pedagogical action research represents the oldest strand of action research, reaching back to the Science of Education movement in the late nineteenth century (Bain, Boone) and revived in the early twentieth century by the work of John Dewey.</description></item><item><title>Kinectic Folds: Interaction Priming</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/kinectic-folds-interaction-priming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/kinectic-folds-interaction-priming/</guid><description>The prototype was inspired by the moment of perceptual crossing that occurs when you meet a stray cat in the street, and a moment of anticipation makes time stand still, as you and the cat try to figure each other out.Using a single sheet of folded paper and embedding it with motors and custom-built touch-capacitive sensors, an object which breathes and responds to the presence of human touch was designed, creating the perception that the Kinetic Fold is alive.</description></item><item><title>Composing Everyday Rituals</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/composing-everyday-rituals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 14:55:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/composing-everyday-rituals/</guid><description>Description Our lives are a collection of rituals. The way we wake up, the way we leave or enter our home, the way we prepare our suitcase before going on a trip are just simple examples of the many rituals each of us have constructed and that structure our everyday lives. These rituals are not rigid procedures, but a seemingly established series of activities from which experiential meaning emerges, and by which personal values are expressed.</description></item><item><title>Experiential design landscapes: how to design for behaviour change, towards an active lifestyle</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/experiential-design-landscapes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/experiential-design-landscapes/</guid><description>This thesis takes on a combined approach, from societal and business development angles, to explore the question of ‘how to design for an active and healthy lifestyle. It follows a Research-through-Design approach, which generates new knowledge through the act of designing. A design-driven research method called Experiential Design Landscapes (EDLs) is developed together with accompanying tools and techniques. With the EDL method, the design process is taken into society by creating infrastructures where designers work together with stakeholders in jointly creating experienceable propositions that can evolve over time.</description></item><item><title>Designing rituals</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/designing-rituals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/designing-rituals/</guid><description>Our lives are a collection of rituals.

The aGravity is a device which lets one experience the challenge of levitation. The fingerboard allows one to float over a straight platform, while experiencing a constant evolving environment within. It creates unique interactions that makes one able to develop a new skill and improve over time. The aGravity aims to make more aware and sensitive to what is being perceived and how the slightest movement can influence the whole system.</description></item><item><title>Data Resonance</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/data-resonance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/data-resonance/</guid><description>What does data feel like? Data Resonance makes the table resonate with surrounding Wi-Fi traffic. Qualities of the digital signals are translated to something you can feel. This gives you a sense of activity at the workplace that is otherwise quiet and hidden. It creates a feedback loop about your own network usage, and a new connection with the activity of colleagues.
Data Resonance is inspired by how the traditional shared workshop acted as an extension of the craftsperson’s body.</description></item><item><title>Sensual Dynamics</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/sensual-dynamics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/sensual-dynamics/</guid><description>Prior to interaction, there is perception. Perception is intrinsically rising from one's actions and from what one senses. These are the way one is connected to the world: acting is the way one impacts the world, sensing is the way one captures it. At this level, in direct contact with the world, there is no information, but energies (or forces). It is these energies and these forces that designers deal with (consciously or unconsciously) when putting a new artefact in the world.</description></item><item><title>Perceptive Qualities in System of Interactive Products</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/perceptive-qualities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/perceptive-qualities/</guid><description>This doctoral project investigates whether and how to design for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products from a phenomenological point of view. It sets out to form and frame a new perspective on designing an artefact's intelligence from a quality- and action-centric approach, rather than a functional approach. Artefacts and the systems they create become increasingly intelligent and disappear to the background of our environment. How do we understand all these intelligible connections that systems create in our environment when they are invisible and highly flexible?</description></item><item><title>Systems Design - The Eindhoven School</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/the-eindhoven-school/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/the-eindhoven-school/</guid><description>The future of design is unclear, as designerly responsibilities are changing. The emphasis used to be on form and production, but as the products to be designed have changed, design has changed. With an interactive product the designer needs to consider not only the form but also the temporal aspects of the product?s interaction and behaviour, and even the specifics of its functionality. While we are starting to understand how to design for interaction through the integrating of form, interaction and function, the next challenge is already in sight: designing for systems.</description></item><item><title>Shift - an installation for the Glow festival</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/shift/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/shift/</guid><description>SHIFT is the product of 18 master students working within OPENLIGHT, the creative lab of the Intelligent Lighting Institute at TU/e.**
Our world is in a constant state of transformation. Most of the time, our view of the world will change parallel to this transformation. The changes in the world are often propelled us as an individual, group, generation or country. Are we aware of the influence we have on our environment?</description></item><item><title>Light in Transition</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/light-in-transition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/light-in-transition/</guid><description>We are accepting technology more and more into our lives as means to enhance the experience of the everyday. Intelligent products and systems are omnipresent, weave into our everyday life, and consequently have the power to transform our society. Adoption of these systems in our environments invites for exploring further how we interact with our environment.
This research is grounded on the phenomenology of perception and ecological psychology, considering perception to be active.</description></item><item><title>Luma</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/luma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/luma/</guid><description>This research project focuses on how to design for perceptive activity in artifacts in order for crossing in perception of expressivity between person and artifact to happen. It is part of the research of Deckers et al (2011), on designing for perceptual crossing between person and artifact. In their work they propose a series of design notions which are meant as a tool for synthesis when designing for perceptive activity in artifacts.</description></item><item><title>Monty</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/monty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/monty/</guid><description>Monty a curious entity that has the ability to perceive activity within its field of vision. When Monty detects activity it will gradually move towards the activity until it is in centre of its perception. If its interest is kept on the activity long enough, Monty becomes engaged and will start taking pictures of the activity.
The envisioned environment in which Monty can be used is a designer’s working environment. Here Monty will mainly be interested in the activity of the designer which will lead to process pictures of all the activities performed by this designer.</description></item><item><title>Passage</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/passage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/passage/</guid><description>(Extrait de mon HDR)
Passage est un projet réalisé en 2012 par Gracia Goh, Chiyong Lim, et Kate Vermeyen à l’Université de Technologie d’Eindhoven. Passage s’intéresse au lieu de transition entre deux espaces physiques, c’est-à-dire à leur entre-espace. L’énoncé du projet invite les étudiant à réaliser un design pour l’entre-espace en évitant d’influencer l’expérience de l’un des deux espaces. Cet énoncé semble a priori phénoménologiquement incohérent, puisque l’expérience d’une chose extérieure à soi a nécessairement lieu dans un espace et demande de plus que l’attention de l’utilisateur soit dirigée au moins partiellement vers cette chose.</description></item><item><title>The Practice of Constructive Design Research</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/practice-cdr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/practice-cdr/</guid><description> The Practice of Constructive Design Research is a conversation proposed by Stoffel Kuenen at the DRS2014 conference.
'Catalysts (=invited participants) for the conversation were researchers in this field: Lorenzo Davoli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Pierre Lévy and Ambra Trotto. In order to feed and frame the conversation, I made a video containing statements taken from interviews with more consolidated researchers: Pelle Ehn, Daniel Fällman, Caroline Hummels, Johan Redström and John Zimmerman.'

Goals are set high, as to commit to a major endeavour: how can design contribute to a new civilisation. The first version was written in 2006 in Bertinoro, Italy, where Caroline Hummels, Kees Overbeeke and I were giving a workshop on Aesthetics of Interaction for the University of Bologna. In this Manifesto, we declared our belief and proposed a vision, concerning how design can change Western thinking towards pervasive ethics.</description></item><item><title>Light through Culture - Experience Human Rights</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/light-through-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/light-through-culture/</guid><description>Light through Culture is an international design school which explores the theme of complexity in learning environments. The aim of the school is to weave the newest technologies and the rich existing culture into a new canvas for making and thinking. The school was funded in 2011 by Patrizia Marti (University of Siena) and Kees Overbeeke (Technical University of Eindhoven).
This ehibition proposes a reflection on the individual vs. social perception of human rights, exploring 2 fundamental and controverted articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</description></item><item><title>Designing Quality in Interaction theory</title><link>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/dqi-theory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2011 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/fr/archives/dqi-theory/</guid><description>In this two-week workshop, theories of interaction design are explained and explored through applications. The DQI approach to Interaction Design is theory informed. This means that theory inspires and even guides the way we look at interaction, and the way we design for interaction and experience.
Topics - Phenomenology and experience (Merlau-Ponty and Dewey)
- Gibsonian theory of perception
- Models of interaction: Interaction Frogger
- Resonance
- Rich Interaction</description></item></channel></rss>
