Stewart has received:
the Core77 award for best interaction design student work
the Golden A’ design award in engineering and technical design
Stewart is a tactile interface designed for a fully autonomous car. Self-driving cars offer obvious benefits such as faster travel and enhanced safety. However, they also eliminate a sense of freedom, expression, and control while driving.
Stewart’s objective is to accommodate a healthy relation between man and machine, to be achieved by an intuitive and expressive form of interaction.
Stewart provides you with constant updates about the car’s behaviour and its intentions. If you don’t agree on the car’s next course of action, you can manipulate Stewart to change this. Stewart will learn from you as you can learn from Stewart, hopefully resulting in a mutually trustful relation.
Interaction through Stewart will bring about a haptic discussion about what the car’s next move will be. Who will win this discussion? Who knows best?
Stewart is on: core77 | Design News | BBC | Creative Applications Network | and many other places…

The aGravity is a device which lets one experience the challenge of levitation. The fingerboard allows one to float over a straight platform, while experiencing a constant evolving environment within. It creates unique interactions that makes one able to develop a new skill and improve over time. The aGravity aims to make more aware and sensitive to what is being perceived and how the slightest movement can influence the whole system.
To get the board hovering, requires focus, concentration and some skill. Though once it is learned to hover the board, it is up to the user how far he or she can go. Giving no precise guidelines, the only rule is to explore, interact and challenge yourself.

The aGravity is a device which lets one experience the challenge of levitation. The fingerboard allows one to float over a straight platform, while experiencing a constant evolving environment within. It creates unique interactions that makes one able to develop a new skill and improve over time. The aGravity aims to make more aware and sensitive to what is being perceived and how the slightest movement can influence the whole system.

Perception is intrinsically rising from one's actions and from what one senses. These are the way one is connected to the world: acting is the way one impacts the world, sensing is the way one captures it. At this level, in direct contact with the world, there is no information, but energies (or forces). It is these energies and these forces that designers deal with (consciously or unconsciously) when putting a new artefact in the world. This primacy of perception towards interaction is the main focus of this workshop, proposing an approach to effectively taking it into consideration in the design process.
For design practical reasons, design should focus on qualities of senses. For example, touching is local, reciprocal, and private. It is where I touch, I am touched by what I am touching, and nobody else can touch what I touch. On the other hand, smell is at a distance, possibly unidirectional, and public. These are qualities of senses that can be useful for design. To be so, these qualities need to determined and mapped. Moreover, we may seek differences between static and dynamics qualities of senses.
Finally, designers should comprehend these qualities and engage them in order to find opportunities for design - how can I make something private at a distance? How can techno challenge these qualities (e.g. headphones make sound private)? What implications for design?

This doctoral project investigates whether and how to design for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products from a phenomenological point of view. It sets out to form and frame a new perspective on designing an artefact's intelligence from a quality- and action-centric approach, rather than a functional approach. Artefacts and the systems they create become increasingly intelligent and disappear to the background of our environment. How do we understand all these intelligible connections that systems create in our environment when they are invisible and highly flexible? Moreover, how do we design for such systems of intelligent and interactive artefacts? I am convinced that if we want to design for successful intelligent systems that are perceptible to and evolve around its user, the artefact's intelligence has to build on the direct interaction with its user(s). It is shown that, by designing for perceptive qualities, the system's activity becomes meaningful to its users. Moreover, the user activity becomes meaningful to the system in the course of the interaction.
The work is inspired by and directly synthesises from theory. The theoretical starting point and the generated design-relevant knowledge, in the form of design notions, are a leitmotiv through this work. Three main chapters are structured around this connecting thread. In each of these chapters, designing plays an essential role. The first chapter follows a minimalist approach in context and in implementation to bring forward fundamental knowledge for designing. The second chapter investigates the added value of the generated knowledge for designing, and a step is made towards design practice. In the third chapter, a third-person perspective corroborates the first-person approach and findings. It is crucial that these three chapters feed into each other to inform, inspire and validate.

In this paper we discuss the last iteration of our ongoing research project on designing for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products. We describe the design of explorative behavior in an artifact to enable the artifact and a person to engage in perceptual crossing. The explorative behavior is compared to the following and active behavior, the results of two earlier iterations. Through the iterations we formulated, applied and evaluated design relevant knowledge in the form of seven design notions.

Here we specifically focus on how the artifact detects active perceptive behavior of a person, and how the artifact becomes aware of bygone perception and anticipates on future perception. An experiment shows how participants preferred the resulting explorative behavior that is closest to our theoretical framework based on phenomenology. 2013-02-13T22:16:36+01:00"><a class="gridbox bg-primary-bg md:hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-700 ease-in-out rounded-md justify-center flex flex-col w-full" href=https://plevy.fr/fr/publications/designing-for-perceptual-crossing-designing-and-comparing-three-behaviors/><div class="w-full flex flex-row"><div class="w-1/3 flex flex-col self-end pt-4 pl-6 mb-4"><div class=inline-block><svg height=".8rem" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 426 171"><path fill="#c81919" d="M74.304 39.125v109.683H40.058V39.125H0V10.633h114.358v28.492H74.304z"/><path fill="#c81919" d="M244.824 119.435c-2.871 6.829-6.979 12.683-12.317 17.562-5.342 4.879-11.783 8.688-19.329 11.417-7.546 2.733-15.921 4.1-25.133 4.1-9.35.0-17.759-1.367-25.238-4.1-7.479-2.729-13.817-6.538-19.025-11.417s-9.212-10.733-12.017-17.562c-2.804-6.834-4.208-14.409-4.208-22.738V10.63h34.05v83.334c0 3.775.5 7.354 1.504 10.733 1 3.388 2.534 6.413 4.604 9.079 2.067 2.667 4.809 4.779 8.213 6.342 3.404 1.562 7.508 2.342 12.317 2.342 4.808.0 8.912-.78 12.316-2.342 3.404-1.563 6.175-3.675 8.313-6.342 2.133-2.666 3.671-5.691 4.604-9.079.933-3.379 1.404-6.958 1.404-10.733V10.63h34.246v86.067c0 8.329-1.433 15.904-4.304 22.738"/><path fill="#c81919" d="M270.321 170.079 339.755.0h-24.8l-69.434 170.079h24.8z"/><path fill="#c81919" d="M373.479 71.427c12.263.0 22.767 7.525 27.15 18.209h-54.3c4.384-10.684 14.888-18.209 27.15-18.209m0-22.387c-28.571.0-51.729 23.162-51.729 51.729.0 28.571 23.158 51.729 51.729 51.729 18.334.0 37.067-8.02 47.179-22.475l-23.462-9.566c-6.246 6.925-14.804 9.658-23.717 9.658-13.15.0-24.279-8.65-28.008-20.571h78.983c.488-2.854.754-5.783.754-8.775.0-28.566-23.158-51.729-51.729-51.729"/></svg></div><div class="inline-block text-xs"><span class="text-xs font-bold">Conference</span><br>13 février 2013</div></div></div><h5 class="block pl-7 pt-6 w-2/3 h-auto text-lg font-semibold">Designing for Perceptual Crossing: designing and comparing three behaviors</h5><p class="block text-sm px-5 py-3 w-11/12 self-end overflow-ellipsis overflow-hidden ...">Deckers, E.J.L., Wensveen, S., Lévy, P., & Ahn, R.

2013-02-13T22:16:36+01:00 Perceptual crossing is the reciprocal interplay of perceiving while being perceived. In this paper we discuss the last iteration of our ongoing research project on designing for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products. We describe the design of explorative behavior in an artifact to enable the artifact and a person to engage in perceptual crossing. The explorative behavior is compared to the following and active behavior, the results of two earlier iterations. Through the iterations we formulated, applied and evaluated design relevant knowledge in the form of seven design notions. These notions inform design-researchers and design-practitioners on how to design for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products. Here we specifically focus on how the artifact detects active perceptive behavior of a person, and how the artifact becomes aware of bygone perception and anticipates on future perception. An experiment shows how participants preferred the resulting explorative behavior that is closest to our theoretical framework based on phenomenology.</div></a></div><div class="item it8 conference w-full md:w-144 px-0 md:px-3 pb-6 block" data-search="publications conference  In this paper we describe seven showcases, namely ‘BeTouched’, ‘Dawe & Valle’, ‘Wonderturf’, ‘IN2WACO’, ‘Blow!’, ‘ShyLight’ and ‘PeR’, that give relevant insights on how to design for perceptive qualities in artifacts.

Intelligent products and systems are omnipresent, weave into our everyday life, and consequently have the power to transform our society. Adoption of these systems in our environments invites for exploring further how we interact with our environment.
This research is grounded on the phenomenology of perception and ecological psychology, considering perception to be active. Perception is result of the dynamic coupling between a person’s action in relation to her or his environment and the sensory input this environment provides. In other words, we have to act to perceive and we concentrate our senses in the direction of the stimuli: e.g., turn our body around to see what is behind us, in order to perceive.
The research focuses on how interaction with interactive artefacts can add intrinsic value on space being experienced as a transitory space. Four topics are introduced to investigate our experience of space as transitory space: ritual, space, light and craft. They serve as the backbone of the project and we could say that the ritual is the means for the technology (light) to enable the value (sense of place) to emerge in interaction with (hand) crafted artefacts. In this project I investigate if an interactive lighting installation can trigger our sense of place and belonging in spaces.
Throughout this project I follow a ‘research-through-design’ approach. This is an approach where products are designed to explore implications of theory in context. The idea of perceptive qualities in interactive lighting installations is explored, and I question if an interactive artefact contributes to the experience of transition and allows for a greater feeling of involvement in the space. The project is divided into three cases:
- In the first case (Homelab), different light behaviours and interaction in a home situation are explored.
- Simultaniously, we investigate the relationship with an interactive artefact in context. In the second design case (Videolab), the influence of an additional object on the space being experienced as transitory space is explored. In the third design case (Mirror), the gained relevant designknowledge is united and expressed in a concluding interactive light object.
    - With this project I aim to get a grip on how interaction with interactive artefacts can add intrinsic value on space being experienced as transitory space.

Intelligent products and systems are omnipresent, weave into our everyday life, and consequently have the power to transform our society. Adoption of these systems in our environments invites for exploring further how we interact with our environment.
This research is grounded on the phenomenology of perception and ecological psychology, considering perception to be active. Perception is result of the dynamic coupling between a person’s action in relation to her or his environment and the sensory input this environment provides. In other words, we have to act to perceive and we concentrate our senses in the direction of the stimuli: e.g., turn our body around to see what is behind us, in order to perceive.
The research focuses on how interaction with interactive artefacts can add intrinsic value on space being experienced as a transitory space. Four topics are introduced to investigate our experience of space as transitory space: ritual, space, light and craft. They serve as the backbone of the project and we could say that the ritual is the means for the technology (light) to enable the value (sense of place) to emerge in interaction with (hand) crafted artefacts. In this project I investigate if an interactive lighting installation can trigger our sense of place and belonging in spaces.
Throughout this project I follow a ‘research-through-design’ approach. This is an approach where products are designed to explore implications of theory in context. The idea of perceptive qualities in interactive lighting installations is explored, and I question if an interactive artefact contributes to the experience of transition and allows for a greater feeling of involvement in the space. The project is divided into three cases:
- In the first case (Homelab), different light behaviours and interaction in a home situation are explored.
- Simultaniously, we investigate the relationship with an interactive artefact in context. In the second design case (Videolab), the influence of an additional object on the space being experienced as transitory space is explored. In the third design case (Mirror), the gained relevant designknowledge is united and expressed in a concluding interactive light object.
- With this project I aim to get a grip on how interaction with interactive artefacts can add intrinsic value on space being experienced as transitory space.

We designed LUMA, an dynamic light design capable of expressing a variable level of excitement thought its perceptive actions. We conducted research using the LUMA design in order to investigate how the stage of perception of expressivity can be reached in an artifact and if crossing of perception of expressivity can happen over the course of interaction between person and artifact. For this we specifically investigate the relation between the perceived expressivity and the occurrence of a cross-influential interplay of expressivity between person and artifact. The results of our experiment show that clarity in variability of this expression is essential for this interplay to occur. We discuss possible changes to the design to improve the clarity in variability of expressivity as well as further research steps.
