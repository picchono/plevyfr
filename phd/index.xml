Design thinking requires practitioners to become reflective professionals. This piece of research provides a protocol and tools to guide their journey of self-reflection:
A new action research protocol (derived from Pedagogical Action Research) for design thinking practitioners, A conceptual framework (People Place Process) to guide design thinking development, in both academic and business environments, A scale-up model to develop design thinking pedagogy at the scale of an individual educator, a university and a government, An activity framework for both academic and business users to identify competences developed with (and required for) design thinking projects Pedagogical action research represents the oldest strand of action research, reaching back to the Science of Education movement in the late nineteenth century (Bain, Boone) and revived in the early twentieth century by the work of John Dewey.</description></item><item><title>Experiential design landscapes: how to design for behaviour change, towards an active lifestyle</title><link>https://plevy.fr/phd/experiential-design-landscapes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/phd/experiential-design-landscapes/</guid><description>This thesis takes on a combined approach, from societal and business development angles, to explore the question of ‘how to design for an active and healthy lifestyle. It follows a Research-through-Design approach, which generates new knowledge through the act of designing. A design-driven research method called Experiential Design Landscapes (EDLs) is developed together with accompanying tools and techniques. With the EDL method, the design process is taken into society by creating infrastructures where designers work together with stakeholders in jointly creating experienceable propositions that can evolve over time.</description></item><item><title>Perceptive Qualities in System of Interactive Products</title><link>https://plevy.fr/phd/perceptive-qualities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/phd/perceptive-qualities/</guid><description>This doctoral project investigates whether and how to design for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products from a phenomenological point of view. It sets out to form and frame a new perspective on designing an artefact's intelligence from a quality- and action-centric approach, rather than a functional approach. Artefacts and the systems they create become increasingly intelligent and disappear to the background of our environment. How do we understand all these intelligible connections that systems create in our environment when they are invisible and highly flexible?</description></item><item><title>Rights through Making - Skills for Pervasive Ethics</title><link>https://plevy.fr/phd/rights-through-making/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/phd/rights-through-making/</guid><description>This thesis starts with a Manifesto, bold, passionate and ambitious. Goals are set high, as to commit to a major endeavour: how can design contribute to a new civilisation. The first version was written in 2006 in Bertinoro, Italy, where Caroline Hummels, Kees Overbeeke and I were giving a workshop on Aesthetics of Interaction for the University of Bologna. In this Manifesto, we declared our belief and proposed a vision, concerning how design can change Western thinking towards pervasive ethics.</description></item></channel></rss>
