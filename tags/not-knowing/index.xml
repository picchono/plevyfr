Through collaborative and evolving reflection, we question the mysteries and blind spots of today&amp;rsquo;s world and of worlds to come, our relationship with the known, the unknown, the hidden and the buried, questioning representations as well as modes of transmission of non-knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Seminar of the school of not-knowing</title><link>https://plevy.fr/events/seminar-school-of-not-knowing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/events/seminar-school-of-not-knowing/</guid><description>This seminar aims to launch the third session of the school of not-Knowing.
