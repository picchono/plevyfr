It is about going to sleep, waking up, cleaning, eating, dressing and undressing, reading, drinking tea or coffee… It is therefore in the flow of the infraordinary (Perec, 1989) and the banal, away of the extraordinary and of the memorable. What the everyday is actually less a matter of activity value than a matter of ‘specific mode of manifestation’ (Dewolf, 2008).</description></item><item><title>Composing Everyday Rituals</title><link>https://plevy.fr/teaching/composing-everyday-rituals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 14:55:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/teaching/composing-everyday-rituals/</guid><description>Our lives are a collection of rituals. The way we wake up, the way we leave or enter our home, the way we prepare our suitcase before going on a trip are just simple examples of the many rituals each of us have constructed and that structure our everyday lives. These rituals are not rigid procedures, but a seemingly established series of activities from which experiential meaning emerges, and by which personal values are expressed.</description></item></channel></rss>
