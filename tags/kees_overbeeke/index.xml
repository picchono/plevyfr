I am very glad to be here. It is an honour to participate to this symposium, and to have the role of opening the series of presentations. It is also a challenge I must say. Kees has been enriching the life of many of us, and I believe many of us would have something valuable to tell based on sharing experiences with Kees.</description></item><item><title>Kees Overbeeke symposium</title><link>https://plevy.fr/event/kees-overbeeke-symposium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/event/kees-overbeeke-symposium/</guid><description>Stephan was appointed full professor of ‘Constructive Design Research in Smart Products, Services and Systems’ in the Department of Industrial Design on May 1, 2017.
