How would our world look like 20, 30, 40 or 50 years from now? Will we monitor each individual on the planet to live a low-risk life? Will we replace organs, eyes, or other parts of our body with artificial alternatives? Will we upload our brains and live on a server? Or do we seek ways to embrace a life more related to mother earth? In this Design Fiction project, several potential healthcare futures are explored. The project is a collaboration between Philips Design, Eindhoven University of Technology, Design Academy Eindhoven, and Frank Kolkman.
When designing and developing for an audience, as was done in this project, a wide range of different opinions have to be dealt with. A well-known example are robots and Artificial intelligence (AI). Some people only see the positive side and potentials: what if robots could take over all our work so we have full-time vacation? Others only see the downsides and risks: what if robots become smarter than people and start attacking us? Either way, the truth will be somewhere in the middle, but it is very important to capture such opinions and discover what society thinks of current developments. The goal of this project was to do exactly that by developing design probes for four potential healthcare futures – based on a framework by Philips Design – and exhibiting them during the Dutch Design Week (DDW) and within Philips to provoke a debate.
During the first part of the project, four teams each developed a design probe for one of the potential futures, which were exhibited at the Dutch Design Week.
The project was continued within another team and a fifth probe was designed based on the insights gathered at the DDW. This time, the focus was laid on preventive healthcare in the present time, which led to the design of a fictive device that helps parents to monitor their baby’s health and aids them in growing a healthy child.

The nature of design thinking projects requires a great capacity to solve situated-inquiry problems (versus technical problem solving – Schön). Design thinking requires practitioners to become reflective professionals. This piece of research provides a protocol and tools to guide their journey of self-reflection:
A new action research protocol (derived from Pedagogical Action Research) for design thinking practitioners,
    A conceptual framework (People Place Process) to guide design thinking development, in both academic and business environments,
    A scale-up model to develop design thinking pedagogy at the scale of an individual educator, a university and a government,
    An activity framework for both academic and business users to identify competences developed with (and required for) design thinking projects
Pedagogical action research represents the oldest strand of action research, reaching back to the Science of Education movement in the late nineteenth century (Bain, Boone) and revived in the early twentieth century by the work of John Dewey. The ultimate goal of reflective teaching is to develop teachers’ skills in ‘‘reflection-in-action”, i.e., their ability to frame and reframe problems, find solutions instantly on the basis of their interpretation and analysis of the situation, and construct new meanings and directions for future actions (Schön). The protocol and tools developed in this research have been adapted to design thinking projects, both in academic and business contexts.

Where intuition is as valuable as logic? Where commitment and engagement are valuable assets for growth? Where people can take a first-person perspective and be in the moment, instead of forever worrying about efficiency?

2013-09-10T20:07:29+02:00 In this month’s cover story, Caroline Hummels and Pierre Lévy propose an alternative, value-based vision for design: Can we create alternative ways to engage with the world based on trusting our senses? Where intuition is as valuable as logic? Where commitment and engagement are valuable assets for growth? Where people can take a first-person perspective and be in the moment, instead of forever worrying about efficiency? Growing out of a long history of work in the Designing Quality in Interaction group at TU Eindhoven, Hummels and Lévy’s vision is rooted in phenomenology and the ideas of 20th-century philosophers such as Dewey, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. Over the course of the article they build their case for this new approach, highlighting projects that illustrate aspects of the vision they outline. As the cover image hints, even typically mundane objects such as vending machines can produce rich, aesthetically rewarding experiences when their design is inspired by phenomenology and its associated values such as embodiment.</div></a></div><div class="item it8 PhD w-full md:w-144 px-0 md:px-3 pb-6 block" data-search="projects PhD 
This thesis starts with a Manifesto, bold, passionate and ambitious. Goals are set high, as to commit to a major endeavour: how can design contribute to a new civilisation. The first version was written in 2006 in Bertinoro, Italy, where Caroline Hummels, Kees Overbeeke and I were giving a workshop on Aesthetics of Interaction for the University of Bologna. In this Manifesto, we declared our belief and proposed a vision, concerning how design can change Western thinking towards pervasive ethics. By pervasive ethics I mean a social praxis aimed at justice and freedom, which pervades society in a capillary way, becoming a Universal attitude that makes people aware of their own rights, able and willing to contribute to seeing their own rights and those of all people fulfilled. I called this approach Rights though Making. The manifesto stated a mission1, which was later applied and validated. The main lines of thoughts of the manifesto have been respected and enforced through several actions. This thesis will describe these actions, the underlying theory and the related reflection both on the approach and on the outcomes. The Manifesto integrated the points of view of the writers, united by a common drive, in a world riddled with all sorts of social uncertainties. In the Manifesto we declared our intention of preparing and doing workshops with students of different nationalities, stimulating the integration of skilful points of view among future designers. When the Manifesto was written, there was not yet a concrete strategy on how to empower people towards pervasive ethics. The only anchor point was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We wanted the values contained in this document materialised, embodied in (intelligent) products or systems. Both the outcome of what we were envisioning (intelligent products or systems empowering towards the realisation of human rights) and the process of realising it (workshop) had to work towards ethics. This was all I knew at that point. Later I designed the way to do it, based on this solid and enthusiastic shared vision.
Throughout the years, the underlying theoretical framework started to acquire its own body. Only after the realisation of the first 5 workshops (out of 7 in total), was I able to explicitly structure and describe the platform of theory that was supporting my endeavour. These actions (the workshops), contributed to the formation of a body of knowledge, of which the potential strength and soundness until then had exclusively been perceived through intuition. This tacit knowledge was dredged out, reflected upon and refined, through iterations of reflection-on-action, in which the “active” parts were the individual workshops.
Thus the forming of this theoretical platform, the refinement of the research quest or design challenge and giving the workshops were overlapping in time and closely intertwined. For clarity, in this thesis I chose to position them in the following order:
Part 1: defining the design challenge / research quest and the Rights through Making Approach;
    Part 2: illustrating the theoretical framework underlying the whole work. This theoretical framework is formed by three elements: (1) Ethics (2) Making and (3) their integration, i.e. how Making empowers towards Ethics: the core of the RtM approach.
    Part 3: describing how this theory is applied in design workshops and how the Rights through Making (RtM) approach evolved;
    Part 4: reflecting on the overall research experience and the underlying personal motivations.
Before this central body I placed and introductory part, containing acknowledgments, rights of the readers, synopsis (this chapter) and tables of contents. After the fourth part, I positioned a part called “Annexes”, which is composed of two main sections:
In the first section I present the RtM workshops in detail, in regard to both the process of each RtM workshop and their evolution;
    In the second section, I illustrate the direction in which I envision the diffusion of RtM in the future, through the realisation of an Internet platform.
 Pervasive ethics is a social praxis aimed at justice and freedom, which pervades society in a capillary way, becoming a Universal attitude that makes people aware of their own rights, able and willing to contribute to seeing their own rights and those of all people fulfilled.<br/><i>Doctoral dissertation of Ambra Trotto</i> 2012-05-15T16:27:15+02:00"><a class="gridbox bg-primary-bg md:hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-700 ease-in-out rounded-md justify-center flex flex-col w-full" href=https://plevy.fr/projects/rights-through-making/><div class="w-full flex flex-row"><div class="w-2/3 h-64"><div class="blend-plevy absolute rounded-md rounded-br-md w-2/3 h-64 m-4"><img src data-toset=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50587487818_8e986d2ef1.jpg class="imag imgBox object-cover rounded-md rounded-br-md w-full h-64" alt="Rights through Making - Skills for Pervasive Ethics" width=500 height=240></div></div><div class="w-1/3 flex flex-col self-end pt-4 pl-6 mb-4"><div class=inline-block><svg height=".8rem" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 426 171"><path fill="#c81919" d="M74.304 39.125v109.683H40.058V39.125H0V10.633h114.358v28.492H74.304z"/><path fill="#c81919" d="M244.824 119.435c-2.871 6.829-6.979 12.683-12.317 17.562-5.342 4.879-11.783 8.688-19.329 11.417-7.546 2.733-15.921 4.1-25.133 4.1-9.35.0-17.759-1.367-25.238-4.1-7.479-2.729-13.817-6.538-19.025-11.417s-9.212-10.733-12.017-17.562c-2.804-6.834-4.208-14.409-4.208-22.738V10.63h34.05v83.334c0 3.775.5 7.354 1.504 10.733 1 3.388 2.534 6.413 4.604 9.079 2.067 2.667 4.809 4.779 8.213 6.342 3.404 1.562 7.508 2.342 12.317 2.342 4.808.0 8.912-.78 12.316-2.342 3.404-1.563 6.175-3.675 8.313-6.342 2.133-2.666 3.671-5.691 4.604-9.079.933-3.379 1.404-6.958 1.404-10.733V10.63h34.246v86.067c0 8.329-1.433 15.904-4.304 22.738"/><path fill="#c81919" d="M270.321 170.079 339.755.0h-24.8l-69.434 170.079h24.8z"/><path fill="#c81919" d="M373.479 71.427c12.263.0 22.767 7.525 27.15 18.209h-54.3c4.384-10.684 14.888-18.209 27.15-18.209m0-22.387c-28.571.0-51.729 23.162-51.729 51.729.0 28.571 23.158 51.729 51.729 51.729 18.334.0 37.067-8.02 47.179-22.475l-23.462-9.566c-6.246 6.925-14.804 9.658-23.717 9.658-13.15.0-24.279-8.65-28.008-20.571h78.983c.488-2.854.754-5.783.754-8.775.0-28.566-23.158-51.729-51.729-51.729"/></svg></div><div class="inline-block text-xs"><span class="text-xs font-bold">PhD</span><br>15 May 2012</div></div></div><h5 class="block pl-7 pt-6 w-2/3 h-auto text-lg font-semibold">Rights through Making - Skills for Pervasive Ethics</h5><p class="block text-sm px-5 py-3 w-11/12 self-end overflow-ellipsis overflow-hidden ...">Pervasive ethics is a social praxis aimed at justice and freedom, which pervades society in a capillary way, becoming a Universal attitude that makes people aware of their own rights, able and willing to contribute to seeing their own rights and those of all people fulfilled.<br><i>Doctoral dissertation of Ambra Trotto</i></p><div class="hidden invisible h-0 w-0">This thesis starts with a Manifesto, bold, passionate and ambitious.
