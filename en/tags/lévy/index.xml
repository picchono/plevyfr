&lt;p>The notion of perceptual crossing indicates the experience of interplay between perceptive activities of multiple beings (train anecdote). Charles Lenay explained the importance of perceptual crossing in the encounter of the other’s perceptual intentionality, in the mutual attraction of perceptual activities (“they come to start a sort of a dance together”), leading to the constitution of a shared world of emotions. Creating such a connection between beings is often experienced, and it is (and it has been for a long time) a quest in design to build such connection between a being (or user) and an artefact: how to design for perceptual crossing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teaching</title><link>https://chaire-design.fr/en/teaching/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 20:03:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://chaire-design.fr/en/teaching/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Writings</title><link>https://chaire-design.fr/en/writings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 20:03:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://chaire-design.fr/en/writings/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
