He holds an engineering degree in mechanical engineering (UT Compiègne, France), a Ph.D in kansei (affective) science (University of Tsukuba, Japan) and an HDR in information and communication sciences (UT Compiègne, France). He has lived for nearly 10 years in Japan (where he worked in industry and then in several Japanese universities) and 12 years in the Netherlands (at the Eindhoven University of Technology).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chaire of design Jean Prouvé</title><link>https://chaire-design.fr/en/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:55:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://chaire-design.fr/en/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Research</title><link>https://chaire-design.fr/en/research/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:55:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://chaire-design.fr/en/research/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="japanese-phylosophy-inspired-design">Japanese phylosophy inspired design&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The notion of perceptual crossing indicates the experience of interplay between perceptive activities of multiple beings (train anecdote). Charles Lenay explained the importance of perceptual crossing in the encounter of the other’s perceptual intentionality, in the mutual attraction of perceptual activities (“they come to start a sort of a dance together”), leading to the constitution of a shared world of emotions. Creating such a connection between beings is often experienced, and it is (and it has been for a long time) a quest in design to build such connection between a being (or user) and an artefact: how to design for perceptual crossing?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
