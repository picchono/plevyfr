Primarily aimed at master&amp;rsquo;s students, young researchers, doctoral candidates and those aspiring to become such, it invites members of research communities linked to the fields of design and creation to contribute together to a better understanding of the methodological issues involved in research as a place for exploration, discussion and the dissemination of ideas and knowledge.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
