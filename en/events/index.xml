&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seminar aims to launch the third session of the school of not-Knowing. The first began in September 2022 at the French Institute in Milan and culminated in the form of a first exhibition in the same place in January 2024. During the second phase the exhibition of around a hundred panels circulated Florence and Rome. New schools joined the initial project by adding new visuals. This set will be presented in Porto as part of the Design Biennale from October 21, 2023, with the support of the French Institute of Portugal.&lt;br>
The third phase is being organized on the basis of around thirty schools and universities, coming from France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Poland, India and Madagascar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>L'irrégularité, une opportunité sociétale</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/irregularite_une_opportunite_societale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/irregularite_une_opportunite_societale/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The beauty of the Japanese pattern</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/beaute-du-motif-japonais/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 09:30:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/beaute-du-motif-japonais/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Inaugural lecture of the Chair of design Jean Prouvé</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/lecon-inaugurale/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 10:30:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/lecon-inaugurale/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-moment-of-design">The moment of design&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Le séminaire « les Médiums en design » est co-animé par CY Design Research, Dicen-IDF et la chaire Design Jean Prouvé du CNAM. Il invite les membres de la communauté de recherche en design à contribuer à la compréhension du design comme éco-système fait d’humains et de non-humains, de vivants et de non-vivants structurant et structuré par les pratiques et les réalisations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Entre méthodes et pratiques en design - un moment d'apprentissage</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/entre-methodes-et-pratiques-en-design-un-moment-d_apprentissage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 10:30:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/entre-methodes-et-pratiques-en-design-un-moment-d_apprentissage/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="entre-méthodes-et-pratiques-en-design---un-moment-dapprentissage">Entre méthodes et pratiques en design - un moment d&amp;rsquo;apprentissage&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Je voudrais m&amp;rsquo;intéresser aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui à la place des méthodes et des pratiques en design, et décrire leur entre-deux comme un lieu de développement des pratiques, c&amp;rsquo;est-à-dire comme moment d&amp;rsquo;apprentissage réflexif sur la pratique.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-le-design">1. Le design&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Le premier point d&amp;rsquo;attention porte sur la notion même de design et la façon dont il est décrit par la propre communauté de recherche en design. Un récent article (Blackler et al., 2021) propose une analyse de vingt ans de discussion sur l&amp;rsquo;une des listes de diffusion les plus actives et renommées dans le monde (PHD-DESIGN List, n.d.) et portant sur la définition du design. Sa conclusion est comme suit (traduit par l&amp;rsquo;auteur) :&lt;br>
&lt;em>Malgré un discours robuste autour des perspectives pertinentes sur le design, les discussions de la liste sont et ont été répétitives, sans aucun progrès significatif vers une définition consolidée du design. […] Nous proposons qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;est peut-être pas possible de définir le design de cette manière, et que le domaine devrait s&amp;rsquo;éloigner de la réitération et discuter de l&amp;rsquo;importance du rôle du design… (Blackler et al., 2021)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Designing for Systemic Change</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/designing-for-systemic-change/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/designing-for-systemic-change/</guid><description>&lt;p>For example, should we focus on local challenges starting from an individual perspective, e.g. your grandmother with dementia that can’t live independently anymore, or should we focus on global challenges starting from the bigger perspective, e.g. how can society maintain a healthy lifestyle?

&lt;p>First, I would like to thank Stephan Wensveen for the organisation and for making this day a such a special one, from start to end (although who knows how it will end…).&lt;br>
I am very glad to be here. It is an honour to participate to this symposium, and to have the role of opening the series of presentations. It is also a challenge I must say. Kees has been enriching the life of many of us, and I believe many of us would have something valuable to tell based on sharing experiences with Kees. I am very conscious of this privilege.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kees Overbeeke symposium</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kees-overbeeke-symposium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kees-overbeeke-symposium/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stephan was appointed full professor of ‘Constructive Design Research in Smart Products, Services and Systems’ in the Department of Industrial Design on May 1, 2017. He will deliver his inaugural lecture ‘Constructive Design Research’ at 16:00.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, there will be a series of lectures by staff and students including Pierre Levy, Caroline Hummels, Luke Noothout and Angella Mackey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guest speakers include Bill Gaver, from the University of London, who will give a talk describing how he and his team has designed DIY devices that people can make themselves: ‘The first is for a collection of cameras and an audio device designed for Cultural Probes studies. The second, a ‘wildlife’ camera that uses computer vision to trigger image capture when it sees movement.’&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>People Place Process: A self-reflection tool to become a professional in design thinking, based on pedagogical action research</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/people-place-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/people-place-process/</guid><description>&lt;p>The nature of design thinking projects requires a great capacity to solve situated-inquiry problems (versus technical problem solving – Schön). Design thinking requires practitioners to become reflective professionals. This piece of research provides a protocol and tools to guide their journey of self-reflection:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A new action research protocol (derived from Pedagogical Action Research) for design thinking practitioners,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A conceptual framework (People Place Process) to guide design thinking development, in both academic and business environments,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A scale-up model to develop design thinking pedagogy at the scale of an individual educator, a university and a government,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An activity framework for both academic and business users to identify competences developed with (and required for) design thinking projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Pedagogical action research represents the oldest strand of action research, reaching back to the Science of Education movement in the late nineteenth century (Bain, Boone) and revived in the early twentieth century by the work of John Dewey. The ultimate goal of reflective teaching is to develop teachers’ skills in ‘‘reflection-in-action”, i.e., their ability to frame and reframe problems, find solutions instantly on the basis of their interpretation and analysis of the situation, and construct new meanings and directions for future actions (Schön). The protocol and tools developed in this research have been adapted to design thinking projects, both in academic and business contexts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perspectives en design d’interaction</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/perspectives-en-design-dinteraction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2016 22:02:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/perspectives-en-design-dinteraction/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Experiential design landscapes: how to design for behaviour change, towards an active lifestyle</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/experiential-design-landscapes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/experiential-design-landscapes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This thesis takes on a combined approach, from societal and business development angles, to explore the question of ‘how to design for an active and healthy lifestyle. It follows a Research-through-Design approach, which generates new knowledge through the act of designing. A design-driven research method called Experiential Design Landscapes (EDLs) is developed together with accompanying tools and techniques. With the EDL method, the design process is taken into society by creating infrastructures where designers work together with stakeholders in jointly creating experienceable propositions that can evolve over time. These propositions, Experiential Probes, are intelligent, open, sensor- enhanced, and networked products service systems that enable people to develop new and emerging behaviours, and in parallel enable detailed analysis of the emerging data patterns by researchers and designers as a source of inspiration for the development of future systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The bases of direct interaction design</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/the-bases-of-direct-interaction-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 21:39:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/the-bases-of-direct-interaction-design/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Direct interaction design</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/direct-interaction-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2013 21:29:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/direct-interaction-design/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Holism and kansei design, kansei beyond borders</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/holism-and-kansei-design-kansei-beyond-borders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 21:55:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/holism-and-kansei-design-kansei-beyond-borders/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="holism-and-kansei-design--kansei-beyond-borders">Holism and kansei design – kansei beyond borders&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the field of kansei research, three main disciplines contribute, in different ways, to the creation of artefacts: kansei engineering, kansei science, and kansei design. In this presentation, I will focus specifically on kansei science and kansei design, and on their differences and similarities. Finally, I will show how these two disciplines are actually complementary and that their collaboration can be relevant.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perceptive Qualities in System of Interactive Products</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/perceptive-qualities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/perceptive-qualities/</guid><description>&lt;p>This doctoral project investigates whether and how to design for perceptive qualities in systems of interactive products from a phenomenological point of view. It sets out to form and frame a new perspective on designing an artefact&amp;rsquo;s intelligence from a quality- and action-centric approach, rather than a functional approach. Artefacts and the systems they create become increasingly intelligent and disappear to the background of our environment. How do we understand all these intelligible connections that systems create in our environment when they are invisible and highly flexible? Moreover, how do we design for such systems of intelligent and interactive artefacts? I am convinced that if we want to design for successful intelligent systems that are perceptible to and evolve around its user, the artefact&amp;rsquo;s intelligence has to build on the direct interaction with its user(s). It is shown that, by designing for perceptive qualities, the system&amp;rsquo;s activity becomes meaningful to its users. Moreover, the user activity becomes meaningful to the system in the course of the interaction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Systems Design - The Eindhoven School</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/the-eindhoven-school/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/the-eindhoven-school/</guid><description>&lt;p>The future of design is unclear, as designerly responsibilities are changing. The emphasis used to be on form and production, but as the products to be designed have changed, design has changed. With an interactive product the designer needs to consider not only the form but also the temporal aspects of the product?s interaction and behaviour, and even the specifics of its functionality. While we are starting to understand how to design for interaction through the integrating of form, interaction and function, the next challenge is already in sight: designing for systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shift - an installation for the Glow festival</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/shift/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/shift/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>SHIFT is the product of 18 master students working within OPENLIGHT, the creative lab of the Intelligent Lighting Institute at TU/e.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Goals are set high, as to commit to a major endeavour: how can design contribute to a new civilisation. The first version was written in 2006 in Bertinoro, Italy, where Caroline Hummels, Kees Overbeeke and I were giving a workshop on Aesthetics of Interaction for the University of Bologna. In this Manifesto, we declared our belief and proposed a vision, concerning how design can change Western thinking towards pervasive ethics. By pervasive ethics I mean a social praxis aimed at justice and freedom, which pervades society in a capillary way, becoming a Universal attitude that makes people aware of their own rights, able and willing to contribute to seeing their own rights and those of all people fulfilled. I called this approach Rights though Making. The manifesto stated a mission1, which was later applied and validated. The main lines of thoughts of the manifesto have been respected and enforced through several actions. This thesis will describe these actions, the underlying theory and the related reflection both on the approach and on the outcomes. The Manifesto integrated the points of view of the writers, united by a common drive, in a world riddled with all sorts of social uncertainties. In the Manifesto we declared our intention of preparing and doing workshops with students of different nationalities, stimulating the integration of skilful points of view among future designers. When the Manifesto was written, there was not yet a concrete strategy on how to empower people towards pervasive ethics. The only anchor point was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We wanted the values contained in this document materialised, embodied in (intelligent) products or systems. Both the outcome of what we were envisioning (intelligent products or systems empowering towards the realisation of human rights) and the process of realising it (workshop) had to work towards ethics. This was all I knew at that point. Later I designed the way to do it, based on this solid and enthusiastic shared vision.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making the world through kansei: 3 Approaches</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/making-the-world-through-kansei-3-approaches/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2012 21:48:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/making-the-world-through-kansei-3-approaches/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Light through Culture - Experience Human Rights</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/light-through-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 16:27:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/light-through-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>Light through Culture is an international design school which explores the theme of complexity in learning environments. The aim of the school is to weave the newest technologies and the rich existing culture into a new canvas for making and thinking. The school was funded in 2011 by Patrizia Marti (University of Siena) and Kees Overbeeke (Technical University of Eindhoven).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ehibition proposes a reflection on the individual vs. social perception of human rights, exploring 2 fundamental and controverted articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 13: Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. Article 19: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Visitors travel through an interactive path, where they experience the application or the negation of such rights. This concurs in stimulating and reinforcing a reflection on their relevance and universality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kansei et kansei design</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-et-kansei-design/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2011 21:21:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-et-kansei-design/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The origin of experience</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/the-origin-of-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2011 21:11:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/the-origin-of-experience/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kansei research in Eurasia</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-research-in-eurasia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2010 21:16:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-research-in-eurasia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kansei Engineering|Science, Trans|Interdisciplinary Research</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-engineering-science-rrans-interdisciplinary-research/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2008 21:03:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-engineering-science-rrans-interdisciplinary-research/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kansei and Kansei Studies: an Overview towards Kansei Design</title><link>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-and-kansei-studies-an-overview-towards-kansei-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2007 20:52:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://plevy.fr/en/events/kansei-and-kansei-studies-an-overview-towards-kansei-design/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
